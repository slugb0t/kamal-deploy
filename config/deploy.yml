# Kamal Deployment Configuration
# This file configures how your Nuxt.js application is deployed using Kamal
# Kamal is a deployment tool that automates containerized app deployment

# Name of your application. Used to uniquely configure containers.
# This name will be used for container names, volumes, and network resources
# Load environment variables from .env file for dynamic configuration
# This allows sensitive data to be kept out of version control
# NOTE: Keep these commented out for CI/CD deployments
# <% require "dotenv" %>
# <% Dotenv.load(".env") %>

service: <%= ENV["KAMAL_APP_NAME"] %>


# Name of the container image.
# This should match your Docker registry and image name
image: <%= ENV["KAMAL_IMAGE_NAME"] %>

# Deploy to these servers.
# Define different server roles for your application
servers:
  web:
    hosts:
      - <%= ENV["KAMAL_SERVER_IP"] %>
  # job:
  #   hosts:
  #     - 192.168.0.1
  #   cmd: bin/jobs

# Enable SSL auto certification via Let's Encrypt and allow for multiple apps on a single web server.
# Remove this section when using multiple web servers and ensure you terminate SSL at your load balancer.
#
# Note: If using Cloudflare, set encryption mode in SSL/TLS setting to "Full" to enable CF-to-app encryption.
proxy:
  ssl: true  # Automatically obtain and configure SSL certificates
  host: <%= ENV["KAMAL_APP_DOMAIN"] %>  # Your application's domain name
  # Proxy connects to your container on port 80 by default.
  app_port: 3000  # Port your Nuxt app runs on inside the container
  forward_headers: true  # Forward client headers to your application
  healthcheck:
    path: /up # Default is /up, change if your app uses a different health check endpoint
    interval: 10  # Interval between health checks in seconds 
    timeout: 10  # Health check timeout in seconds

# Credentials for your image host.
# Configure access to your Docker registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
registry:
  # Specify the registry server, if you're not using Docker Hub
  # server: <%= ENV["KAMAL_REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER"] %>
  username: <%= ENV["KAMAL_REGISTRY_USERNAME"] %>

  # Always use an access token rather than real password (pulled from .kamal/secrets).
  # This is more secure than using your actual password
  password:
    - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Configure builder setup.
# Settings for building your Docker image
builder:
  arch: amd64  # Target architecture for the built image
  # Pass in additional build args needed for your Dockerfile.
  # args:
  #   RUBY_VERSION: <%= ENV["RBENV_VERSION"] || ENV["rvm_ruby_string"] || "#{RUBY_ENGINE}-#{RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION}" %>

# Inject ENV variables into all containers (secrets come from .kamal/secrets).
# Environment variables are available to your application at runtime
env:
  clear:
    NODE_ENV: test  # Set to 'production' for production deployments
  secret:
    - DATABASE_URL  # Database connection string
    - DB_HOST       # Database host address

# Aliases are triggered with "bin/kamal <alias>". You can overwrite arguments on invocation:
# "bin/kamal app logs -r job" will tail logs from the first server in the job section.
# These are convenient shortcuts for common operations
aliases:
  web-shell: app exec --interactive --reuse "sh"  # Access shell in web container
  db-shell: accessory exec db --interactive --reuse "bash"  # Access PostgreSQL shell
  db-backup-shell: accessory exec db-backup --interactive --reuse "sh"  # Access backup container shell
  backup-db: accessory exec db-backup --interactive "sh ./backup.sh"  # Run database backup
  restore-db: accessory exec db-backup --interactive "sh ./restore.sh"  # Restore database from backup

# Use a different ssh user than root
# Uncomment and configure if you need to use a non-root user for SSH access
#
# ssh:
  # user: dev

# Use a persistent storage volume.
# Uncomment to add persistent storage that survives container restarts
#
# volumes:
#   - "app_storage:/app/storage"

# Bridge fingerprinted assets, like JS and CSS, between versions to avoid
# hitting 404 on in-flight requests. Combines all files from new and old
# version inside the asset_path.
# This is useful for Nuxt.js applications with built assets
#
# asset_path: /public/assets

# Configure rolling deploys by setting a wait time between batches of restarts.
# This ensures zero-downtime deployments by updating containers gradually
#
# boot:
#   limit: 10 # Can also specify as a percentage of total hosts, such as "25%"
#   wait: 2

# Use accessory services (secrets come from .kamal/secrets).
# These are additional services that your application depends on
